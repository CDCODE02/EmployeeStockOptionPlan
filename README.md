# Employee Stock Option Plan Smart Contract Challenge

## Task
You are tasked with designing and implementing a smart contract for an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) on the Ethereum blockchain. The ESOP allows a company to grant stock options to its employees, define vesting schedules, and enable employees to exercise their vested options. Your goal is to create a secure, efficient, and user-friendly smart contract, named `EmployeeStockOptionPlan`, that manages the ESOP.

## Smart Contract Specifications
- Smart Contract Language: Solidity (version 0.8.0 or higher)
- Blockchain Platform: Ethereum

## Employee Stock Option Plan Functionality
Implement the following functionalities in the `EmployeeStockOptionPlan` smart contract:

### 3.1. Granting Stock Options
- Implement a function, `grantStockOptions`, that allows the company (contract owner) to grant stock options to an employee by specifying their address and the number of options.
- Emit an event, `StockOptionsGranted`, to log the grant of stock options.

### 3.2. Vesting Schedule
- Implement a function, `setVestingSchedule`, that allows the company to set the vesting schedule for an employee's options.

### 3.3. Exercising Options
- Implement a function, `exerciseOptions`, that allows an employee to exercise their vested options.

### 3.4. Tracking Vested and Exercised Options
- Implement functions, `getVestedOptions` and `getExercisedOptions`, to retrieve the number of vested and exercised options for an employee.

### 3.5. Security and Permissions
- Implement appropriate access control to ensure that only authorized employees can exercise their options.

### 3.6. Ownership and Transferability
- Implement a function, `transferOptions`, that allows employees to transfer their vested options to other eligible employees, subject to any transfer restrictions specified in the vesting schedule.

## Your Task
Design and implement the `EmployeeStockOptionPlan` smart contract based on the provided skeleton code in the file `EmployeeStockOptionPlan.sol`. Your implementation should fulfill the following requirements:

### 4.1. Functionality
The smart contract should correctly handle the granting of stock options, setting of vesting schedules, exercising of options, and tracking of vested and exercised options.

### 4.2. Security
Ensure the smart contract follows best practices for security, including protection against common attacks like reentrancy, overflow/underflow, and unauthorized access.

### 4.3. Documentation
Include comprehensive documentation that explains the design decisions, contract architecture, and usage instructions. Code comments should be provided where necessary to improve code readability and maintainability.

Use the provided skeleton code in the file `EmployeeStockOptionPlan.sol` as a starting point for your implementation. Feel free to modify and expand the code as needed to fulfill the requirements.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

### 5.1. Correctness
The smart contract should implement the specified functionality accurately and without any critical bugs.

### 5.2. Documentation
Include comprehensive documentation that explains the design decisions, contract architecture, and usage instructions. Code comments should be provided where necessary to improve code readability and maintainability.

Please note that the provided skeleton code is a starting point and may require further modifications and additions based on your implementation strategy and requirements.
